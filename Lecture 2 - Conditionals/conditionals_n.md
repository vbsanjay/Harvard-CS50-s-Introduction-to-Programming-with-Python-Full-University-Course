# Conditionals

## What are conditionals in Python?
- Conditionals in Python are used to make decisions in code based on whether certain conditions are true or false.
- They control the flow of execution in a program.
- The main conditional statements in Python are `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else`.
- They are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

## What are some common pitfalls and best practices when using conditionals in Python?
- **Pitfalls:**
  - Forgetting the colon (`:`) after `if`, `elif`, or `else` statements.
  - Incorrect indentation of code blocks under conditionals, leading to syntax errors.
  - Using `=` (assignment) instead of `==` (equality check) in conditions.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use meaningful condition names and variables to improve code readability.
  - Keep conditions simple and avoid nesting too deeply to maintain clarity.
  - Use `elif` instead of multiple nested `if` statements for better readability and performance in some cases.
