# Math

## Explain the math.pow() function and how it differs from the ** operator.
- math.pow(x, y): Returns x raised to the power y, where both x and y are floats.
- x ** y: Returns x raised to the power y, where x and y can be integers or floats.

## Describe the math.trunc() function and when you might use it.
- math.trunc(x): Returns the integer part of x by truncating the fractional part towards zero.

## Precision Loss with Floating Point Arithmetic
- Due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic, calculations may suffer from precision loss, especially in divisions and complex mathematical operations.
- If precision is critical, consider using the decimal module for high-precision arithmetic instead of float. This is especially important in financial or scientific applications.

## Handling of Large Numbers
- Python's int type can handle arbitrarily large integers, but operations involving very large numbers might be slower compared to languages with fixed-width integers.

## NaN and Infinity Handling
- Be cautious when using functions like math.sqrt() with negative numbers or division by zero, which can result in NaN (Not a Number) or Infinity values.

## Rounding Errors
- Rounding errors can occur when converting between float and Decimal types, especially in financial applications requiring precise calculations.

## Handling Edge Cases
- Be mindful of edge cases such as division by zero (ZeroDivisionError) or domain errors (ValueError for functions like math.sqrt() with negative arguments). Handle these using try-except blocks if necessary.
